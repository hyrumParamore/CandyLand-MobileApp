# CandyLand-MobileApp
```Personal Software Development Project```

# Overview

This project that I decided to do was to test myself to learn and build my skills as a software developer. I wanted to test myself in a 2-week sprint to see what I could learn and build with the knowledge that I have developed and the tools that are around me. I specifically wanted to learn how to build a mobile IOS app so that I can learn what is required and what it takes to be an IOS developer. With that being said, I present you the CandyLand Mobile app.


This app provides a way to play the classic board game Candyland without needing to organize or find the cards. It is all digital and requires a phone and a finger to swipe the cards away. 


How this app is used is very simple, you open the app and will instantly be greeted with a deck of cards. When playing the board game and it is your turn, all you need to do is swipe the top card away to reveal your new card. These are randomly chosen from all the regular cards in the game.


The purpose of creating this app was because of an issue that comes up when playing the board game Candyland. That is that kids play this game a lot and as we all know, they can easily ruin or lose the playing cards that are provided. This solves that problem and allows for a more fluid way to play.
